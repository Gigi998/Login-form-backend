# Login form project

Project in Action - [Loginform](https://basic-login-3h1f.onrender.com)

## Inspired

I have watched node js tutorial by Dave Gray - [NodeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2EqECiTBL8&t=107s)<br>
I also have watched react-auth tutorial - [ReactAuth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brcHK3P6ChQ&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PRCpm9clX0WiBEMB70FWwd)

Most of the principles were taken from these tutorials.

## Technologies

- server => node(express)
- DB => mongoDB(mongoose)
- authorization => jsonwebtoken

## About

- This is backend code from login-form-project.
- There are two APIs: users and employees. CRUD operations were
  implemented on employees API.
- Authorization => jsonwebtoken(access and refresh), roles access
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
